Build a production-ready website Mal’s Mandi (e-commerce style but NO ordering / NO cart / NO checkout) using:
Next.js (TypeScript) with Pages Router and Static Generation (SSG) for home/category/product pages.
TinaCMS for an editor-friendly CMS at /admin.
Storage must be file-based (Git-backed): products & categories stored as JSON/MD files in the repo (no database).
Deploy target: Vercel (static + Next pages). Ensure it works on Vercel.
Make the site modern, theme (White, Black, magenta, etc)

Data + file structure (must implement)
content/categories/<slug>.json
{ "title": "Shoes", "slug": "shoes" }
content/products/<slug>.json
Example:
{
  "name": "Nike Air Max",
  "slug": "nike-air-max",
  "category": "shoes",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "mainImage": "/uploads/nike-air-max-main.jpg",
  "images": ["/uploads/nike-air-max-1.jpg", "/uploads/nike-air-max-2.jpg"],
  "active": true
}


Images must live in public/uploads/ so they deploy cleanly on Vercel. CMS image picker should point to this folder.
TinaCMS schema (must implement)
Collection: categories
fields: title (string, required), slug (string, required)
Collection: products
fields:
name (string, required)
slug (string, required)
category (string required; use select options built dynamically from categories collection OR reference field)
description (string textarea, optional)
mainImage (image required)
images (list of images)
active (boolean default true)
Make sure adding a new category in CMS makes it available in the product category dropdown.
Rendering logic (SSG)
Implement helpers that read JSON files from content/:
getAllCategories()
getAllProducts()
getProductsByCategory(slug)
getProductBySlug(slug)
Use getStaticProps + getStaticPaths for:
/category/[slug]
/product/[slug]
Home can be getStaticProps.
Add graceful fallback pages (404).
WhatsApp link helper (must implement)
Create a small utility:
makeWhatsAppLink({ phone, text }) => https://wa.me/<phone>?text=<encoded>
Use encodeURIComponent.
On product page, include product absolute URL; build from NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL (fallback to http://localhost:3000 in dev).
